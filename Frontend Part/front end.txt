Web Tech (Frontend) :
* There are 4  technologies are used to develop or design web sites or web applications.
* These technologies are called as Frontend/Client side technology.

HTML:
* HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. Version - 5
* It is used to design structure of web pages.
* It is used to design "Static web pages".

CSS : 
* CSS stands for Cascading style sheet. Version - 2
* It is used to change the look and feel of web pages(make over) , animations,......etc.

JAVASCRIPT:
* Latest Version - 6 
* It is used to make web pages dynamic.
* It follows ECMAScript.
* It is used to make web pages interactive.

BOOTSTRAP:
* Latest Version - 5
* It is used to make web pages responsive.
* It is used to make web pages mobile friendly.
* It is the framework of CSS 

Web Technologies are divided into 2 ways:

1. Frontend Technologies (Client side):
----------------------------------------
* It is directly interactable to user those are called as "FET".
* It is used to store in server, but translation,execution and producing output in client sysetem.
* No need to download and install any software.
* Generally to design the web pages.
* EX: HTML,css,JS,bs,xml......etc


2. Backend Technologies (server side):
---------------------------------------
* It doesnt store directly interactable to user those are called as "BET".
* It is used to storing,translation,execution in server, but it producing output in client sysetem.
* Need one core software and one web server/application server.
* EX: Python + uvicorn.
* Generally to perform server side operations, like db , session, authentication operations.....etc.
* EX: servelt,springmvc,django,php,nodejs,asp.net,perl,ruby.....etc.


Server:
-------
* It is one type of computer(super).
* It stores data, files, db, related projects(web site/application).
* It provides data services to client machines.
* Types of servers: web server , application server, db server , proxy servers,mailing server, dns server.....etc.

Client:
-------
* It is a device (electronic, electric, auto.....)
* client devices are supporting browsing.
* EX : computer, tv, watch, projector, car, bike......etc.
* It is interface/media between end-user and server.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- HTML --------------------------------------------------------------

* HTML was developed by "Tim-Berners-Lee". It was released in 1993 and maintained by W3C org.
* SGML ---> Standard Generalized Markup Language.
* HTML ---> HyperText Markup Language.
* The web was born in a particle physics laboratory(CERN) in geneva,switerland in 1989.
* Technically, HTML is not a progrmming language,but rather than a Markup language. HTML is a tag oriented progrmming.
* HTML is used to design "Static web pages".means HTML is used to create element(such as heading,paragraphs,icons,menus,logs,textboxes,buttoons,....etc) in the web pages.
* Static web pages means, that page always showing same information.
*HTML is used in all real time web sites today. HTML is the onlly language that is supported by all web browsers and available for desigining web pages.
* HTML is a 'Client-side tech'.That means the html code executes on the client browsers but not in servers.
* HTML is supported by all the browsers such as google chrome , Mozilla , firefox, Edge,......etc.
* HTML is case insensitive language that means you can write the html code in either uppercase (or) lowercase.
* HTML is a error free progrmming.
* For working html no need to install any software. Browser is responsible for executing and producing output of html code.
        Typing and saving -------> Notepad
        Execution and output ------> Browser.
* HTML is a interpreter-based language. Browser interprects HTML code.

TAG:
----
* It is a pre-defined program,set of instructions.
    browser => html,css,JS
* Browser following these instructions and produces output.
* If we write wrong code it wont raises the error.
* Tag is an end word, every tag name should be enclosed with <>.
* EX:  <h1>, <img>, <table>
        <button> Login </button>

----> Types of tags:
--------------------
* Bascially tags are classified into 2-types.
1.Paired tags.
2.unpaired tags.

1.Paired tags:
---------------
* It is a tag which has opening and closing tags.
* These parent tags are called as body tags.
    Syntax:
        <tag></tag>
EX: <h1>, <p>, <table>, <img>, <a>, <div>, <span>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <form>, <input>, <select>, <option>, <textarea>, <label>, <button>, <br>, <hr>, <hr/>, <meta>, <title>, <head>, <body>, <html>, <!DOCTYPE>, <script>, <style>, <link>, <meta>, <iframe>, <video>, <audio>, <canvas>, <svg>, <math>, <svg>, <math>, <svg>, <math>, <svg>, <math>, <svg>, <math>, <svg>, <math>, <svg>, <math>, <svg>, <math>, <svg>, <math>, <svg>,

2. Unpaired Tags:
------------------
* It is a tag which has opening tags only.
* These parent tags are called as self closing tags.
* These tags are not having closing tags.
* These tags are not having body tags.

Syntax:
        <tag/>
* EX: <br> , <link/> , </meta>.............etc.

STRUCTURE OF HTML:
------------------
* As per W3C org we have to follow the following structure of web design pages.

<html>
<head></head>
<body></body>
</html>

* Generally structure of html having 3 sections are:
1. Versioning section
2. Head section.
3. Body section.

1. Versioning section:
-----------------------
* This is providing info to the browser which version we are using in web/program.
* So browser is interprecting code and producing output as per given specification.

2. Head section:
-----------------
* It contains page settings and configurations.
* EX: title,link,base,css,meta..etc.

3. Body section:
-----------------
* It contains page content.
* EX: h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6,p,img,table,form,input,select,textarea,button,a,div,span,ul,ol,li,iframe,video,audio,canvas,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math,svg,math

* COMMENT LINES:
-----------------
* Comments lines are to provide some description about our program
* Comments lines are not executed by the browser.
* Comments lines are not visible in the output.

Syntax :   <!--Comments-->

Heading Tags: 
--------------
* These tags are used to print data/text in heading format with different sizes.
* HTML provides 6 heading tags, those are h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6
* six tags are paired tags and block level elements.

Syntax :  <h1>Text</h1>....................<h6>Text</h6>
Note: Inside the body section we can repeat any tag and no.of times.

<html>
    <head>
        <title> 
            Welcome to my page
        </title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <h3>Welcome</h3>
        <h4>Welcome</h4>
        <h5>Welcome</h5>
        <h6>Welcome</h6>
    </body>
</html>

Paragraph Tag:
--------------
* 'p' means Paragraph
* p tag used to print multiple lines of text.
* p tag is a paired tag and block level element.

Syntax:  <p> text or data </p>
* EX: 

<html>
    <head>
        <title> 
            Welcome to my page
        </title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <p>
            Coding tells a machine which actions to perform and how to complete tasks.
        </p>
    </body>
</html>

* Difference between block element and inline element.
-------------------------------------------------------
Block element:
--------------
* It covers the whole horizontal line in which they are used.
* Heights and widths are key properties that can be used with block elements.
* It accepts the margins from all sides i.e top,bottom,left,right.
* Block elements like div and semantic tags are extensively used for defining layouts od the web page.
* It is force a new line before and after they are used.
* Block elements break the flow of the current line by forcing line breaks.
* EX: <div></div> , <h1></h1> , <p></p>......etc.

Inline element:
---------------
* Inline elements cover only the area which is required for the content it holds.
* Heights and widths are not considered for inline elements
* Only left and right margins have an effect on inline elements
* Inline elements are used generally to give inline styles and effects.
* Inline elements do not force any new line
* Inline elements continue the flow of the current line without any line breaks
* EX: <span></span> , <a></a> , <button></button>......etc.

Break Tag:
----------
* br stands for break line.
* br tag used to move the cursor to the beginning of next line.
* It is unpaired and block level tag.

*EX: <br> (or) </br>

HTML Entities:
--------------
* Entities nothing but special characters or operators.
* Special characters are used to perform some task (or) to print some symbols.
* Special characters are not allowed in html pages.
* Special characters is a english word.

Syntax : &word;
        &frac34; , &divide 
* Hexa decimal codes, these operators are starts with "#".
  Hexa-dec base 16 ---> 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f 

Syntax : &#hex-code
        &#6digits; &#4digits;
        &#128526 ===> print emojis

EX:

<html>
    <head>
        <title> 
            Welcome to my page
        </title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <b>Apple</b>
