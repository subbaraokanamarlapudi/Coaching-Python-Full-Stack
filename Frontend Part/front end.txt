Web Technologies are divided into 2 ways:

1. Frontend Technologies (Client side):
----------------------------------------
* It is directly interactable to user those are called as "FET".
* It is used to store in server, but translation,execution and producing output in client sysetem.
* No need to download and install any software.
* Generally to design the web pages.
* EX: HTML,css,JS,bs,xml......etc


2. Backend Technologies (server side):
---------------------------------------
* It doesnt store directly interactable to user those are called as "BET".
* It is used to storing,translation,execution in server, but it producing output in client sysetem.
* Need one core software and one web server/application server.
* EX: Python + uvicorn.
* Generally to perform server side operations, like db , session, authentication operations.....etc.
* EX: servelt,springmvc,django,php,nodejs,asp.net,perl,ruby.....etc.


Server:
-------
* It is one type of computer(super).
* It stores data, files, db, related projects(web site/application).
* It provides data services to client machines.
* Types of servers: web server , application server, db server , proxy servers,mailing server, dns server.....etc.

Client:
-------
* It is a device (electronic, electric, auto.....)
* client devices are supporting browsing.
* EX : computer, tv, watch, projector, car, bike......etc.
* It is interface/media between end-user and server.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- HTML --------------------------------------------------------------

* HTML was developed by "Tim-Berners-Lee". It was released in 1993 and maintained by W3C org.
* SGML ---> Standard Generalized Markup Language.
* HTML ---> HyperText Markup Language.
* The web was born in a particle physics laboratory(CERN) in geneva,switerland in 1989.
* Technically, HTML is not a progrmming language,but rather than a Markup language. HTML is a tag oriented progrmming.
* HTML is used to design "Static web pages".means HTML is used to create element(such as heading,paragraphs,icons,menus,logs,textboxes,buttoons,....etc) in the web pages.
* Static web pages means, that page always showing same information.
*HTML is used in all real time web sites today. HTML is the onlly language that is supported by all web browsers and available for desigining web pages.
* HTML is a 'Client-side tech'.That means the html code executes on the client browsers but not in servers.
* HTML is supported by all the browsers such as google chrome , Mozilla , firefox, Edge,......etc.
* HTML is case insensitive language that means you can write the html code in either uppercase (or) lowercase.
* HTML is a error free progrmming.
* For working html no need to install any software. Browser is responsible for executing and producing output of html code.
        Typing and saving -------> Notepad
        Execution and output ------> Browser.
* HTML is a interpreter-based language. Browser interprects HTML code.

TAG:
----
* It is a pre-defined program,set of instructions.
    browser => html,css,JS
* Browser following these instructions and produces output.
* If we write wrong code it wont raises the error.
* Tag is an end word, every tag name should be enclosed with <>.
* EX:  <h1>, <img>, <table>
        <button> Login </button>

----> Types of tags:
--------------------
* Bascially tags are classified into 2-types.
1.Paired tags.
2.unpaired tags.

1.Paired tags:
---------------
* It is a tag which has opening and closing tags.
* These parent tags are called as body tags.
    Syntax:
        <tag></tag>
EX: <h1>, <p>, <table>, <img>, <a>, <div>, <span>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <form>, <input>, <select>, <option>, <textarea>, <label>, <button>, <br>, <hr>, <hr/>, <meta>, <title>, <head>, <body>, <html>, <!DOCTYPE>, <script>, <style>, <link>, <meta>, <iframe>, <video>, <audio>, <canvas>, <svg>, <math>, <svg>, <math>, <svg>, <math>, <svg>, <math>, <svg>, <math>, <svg>, <math>, <svg>, <math>, <svg>, <math>, <svg>, <math>, <svg>,

2. Unpaired Tags:
------------------
* It is a tag which has opening tags only.
* These parent tags are called as self closing tags.
* These tags are not having closing tags.
* These tags are not having body tags.

Syntax:
        <tag/>
* EX: <br> , <link/> , </meta>.............etc.
