'''
We can use assignment operator to assign a value to the variable.
Ex:
		x = 10

-->We can cobmine assignment operator with some other operator to form compound assignment operator.
Ex:
		x += 10 ===>x = x+10

-->Compound assignment operators are:
		+=,-=,*=,/=,..............

-->No increment and decrement operators in python.
Ex:
		x++(Invalid)
		x--(Invalid)
		+(+x) ==>(valid)
		-(-x)==>(valid)
